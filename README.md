# Weather Dashboard
## Description

<a href="https://samanthashleyrose.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/">The Weather Dashboard Site</a> uses  HTML, CSS, and JS in conjunction with OpenWeather's API Documention. The user can simply enter a zip code or select from the list of Popular Cities and the current weather information will populate as well as the 5-day forecast.

OpenWeather's API was extremely useful during this project. By gathering the needed data in JavaScript, the site is able to display:
- The city name
- The date
- The temperature (current/high/low)
- The wind speed
- The humidity levels
